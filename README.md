# Angular-Course-Exercises

This repository contains the code for several exercises I completed during my Angular course. These exercises helped me develop my skills and knowledge of the framework.

## Exercise 1:

Implementation of a component that gets an array from a service and displays the length and each element's value in the array.

### Learned:
*Creating components - string interpolation - data binding - directives - services concept - dependency injection*

<br/>

## Exercise 2:

Implementation of a favorite component (toggled between an empty heart and a filled heart when clicked).

### Learned:
*Property binding - attribute binding - bootstrap - class binding - style binding - event binding - event bubbling - event filtering - template variable*

<br/>

## Exercise 3:

Implementation of an input field that writes its value in a box but with a custom pipe (capitalized each word except prepositions).

### Learned:
*Two-way data binding (ngModel) - pipes - make a custom pipe*
